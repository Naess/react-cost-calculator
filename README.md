A flexible calculator for a user to generate a total value based on a number of inputs and options.

*To install:*
- Clone or download the code
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start` to run the Webpack dev server. A new tab at http://localhost:3000/ should show up with the app.

*Customizing:*
There's a file called `options.config.json` which stores the options and default values for each item in the form. To add new elements, just add them to this file and include the component to the render function in `Calculator.js`.
